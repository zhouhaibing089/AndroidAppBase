AndroidAppBase
==============

As its name sugguests, this project aims to provide a quick start approach to develop android application.

### Why need this

Obviously or not, when you begin the android(or anything else) developement from scratch, you have to rebuild a lot of wheels, including the library integration, the often-used view implementation and so on. we do not want that, we hope that our experience do give us a great help, so I create this project to make many things easier in the next android project.

### What it contains

At the time I write this README, this project contains some view implementation.

### TabBar

This is the android mock for UITabBar from iOS platform.

### NavBar

This is the android mock for NavigationBar from iOS platform.

### SearchBar

This is the android mock for SearchBar from iOS platform.
